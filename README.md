## TensorFlowOnYARN [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Intel-bigdata/TensorFlowOnYARN.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Intel-bigdata/TensorFlowOnYARN)

This project focuses on support of running Tensorflow on YARN, as part of Deep Learning on Hadoop ([HDL](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HDL)) effort.

Both the codebase and documentation are **work in progress**.
